#####After this trend of Warbots I decided to make a open bot for anyone to use

  * * *
  * **Features**
    * _**Teams:**_ It's allowed to set up a war in teams, same team members can't fight each other. The only remaining team wins.
    * _**Random:**_ The small random dice roll function is completely random, but gives a little help to those participants with more kills.
    * _**Variable time:**_ You can set the amount of time between battles easily before starting the bot, it will keep you informed between battles.
  
  _More features Coming_

* * *
* **TODO**
  * _Twitter integration_, add the twiter API to report directly through twitter.
  * _Persistence_, in case of crash, power outage or any other reason to lose progress.
  * _More settings_, Read settings from a text file and more customizations, like team sizes and friend fire.
  * _MultiPlatform_, add releases for Linux and MacOS.
  * _Exceptions_, Errors are processsed through loops and standar outputs, add exceptions to process errors more easily.
  * _Releases_, Add donwloads in the release tab of this repo.
  
  * * *
  
  **Instructions:**
  - Get the bot:
      - Get the **Main.exe** from bin/ folder and run it
      - Get the project and run the **Build.bat** to build it by yourself
  - Follow the guide inside the program.
  - Teams should have atleast 1 member at start.
  - Time between battles work best with longer periods, like 1 hour.
